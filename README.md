# String-Calculator

Using a Test Driven and Object Oriented approach, create a simple String Calculator which covers the following requirements:

1. adds numbers present in the input, e.g "1,2" = 3
2. treats empty or null input as zero, e.g "" = 0, null = 0
3. supports different delimiters, e.g "1,2,3", "1 2 3"
4. does not support negative numbers
5. ignores numbers greater than 100
